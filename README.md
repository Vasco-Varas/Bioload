# Bioload
Bioload takes your CD-HIT virome protein clustering results and generates a tab-delimited table linking proteins in your dataset with Tara virome protein clusters (TOV) and their metadata. Bioload can help you classify your own proteins into Tara Ocean Virome protein clusters as in Brum et al. 2015.
